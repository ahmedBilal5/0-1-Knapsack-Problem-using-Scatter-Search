# 0-1-Knapsack-Problem-using-Scatter-Search

Scatter Search is a evolutionary metahueristic similiar to the class of Algorithms known as Genetic Algorithms. It is different to Genetic Algorithms in a few ways. For example, it uses a special and slightly sophisticated method for combining solutions instead of the traditional crossover operator used by Genetic Algorithms. This method is called the Progressive Crossover and uses a technique known as Path Relinking.

Scatter Search has problem dependant implementations. For my project, I implemeneted Scatter Search with Path Relinking for the 0/1 Knapsack problem, a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The language I have used is C++.

A detailed report (Report.docx) is attatched explaining the workings of Scatter Search and Path Relinking as well the challenges in implementation. Finally, it contains a psuedo-code of the complete Algorithm consistent with the coded implementation. This report was written and compiled by me and 3 classmates whose names have been mentioned in the report.
